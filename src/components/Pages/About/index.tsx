      <p>
        Hi, I'm James and I'm a software engineer from Queens, New York. I
        currently work full-time as a Lead Backend Engineer @ BRKFST.IO . I
        primarily use TypeScript as my main language for creating solutions. I
        mostly build apps for the web, but also enjoy programming on all
        platforms. I focus on providing simplicity for both users and
        developers. In the words of Robert C. Martin, “It is not the language
        that makes programs appear simple. It is the programmer that makes the
        language appear simple!”. I've been writing code for over 7 years and
        I'm still learning every day. I still have the same passion for growing
        and learning as I did when I first embarked on this path. I love to
        share my passion and knowledge so feel free to connect with me.
      </p>
